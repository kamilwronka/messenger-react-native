# messenger-react-native
React native messenger

Basic functionality is ready. This is my "learning" project so many features can be buggy.

Roadmap here: https://trello.com/b/yn3QwN8Q/frontend (in polish)

## How to run

* *git clone https://github.com/kamilwronka/messenger-react-native.git*
* *cd messenger-react-native*
* *yarn* or *npm install*
* *react-native link*
* *react-native run-android* or *react-native run-ios*

It requires backend server to work, so you have to run this: https://github.com/kamilwronka/messenger-backend.
After running backend server set your ROOT_URL and AWS_BUCKET in */src/api_config.js*
